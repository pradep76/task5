      Wow! This tour made me realize how much I love mountains. After going on
      one of these tours, I can safely say that they are my favorite
      geographic feature, and my favorite word that starts with M.

      I never understood why people cared so much about mountains. But then I
      went on one of these tours. Now I can't understand people who don't care
      about mountains!
